          <b>Slicers</b> are:

        <p>
          Slicers can be used to split payments dynamically between multiple
          owners, or to sell anything in a decentralized manner.
        </p>
        <p>Generally you may want to either:</p>

        <p>
          Anyone holding at least the amount of superowner slices (specified
          during the creation of the slicer).
        </p>
        <p>Superowners have privileged access to a slicer, allowing them to:</p>

        <p>
          It is up to the slicer creator to decide how many can eventually
          become superowners, by setting the <i>superowner slices</i> amount.
          The lower it is, the higher the number of potential superowners.

        <p>
          With Slice products everything is efficiently stored on the blockchain

          <li>
            <b>Digital services, subscriptions, apps:</b> In this case it&apos;s
            the service provider that validates the purchase before providing
            the service. This could happen automatically or manually.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Physical items:</b> In order for the seller to handle
            fulfillment, a link should be added in the instructions to redeem
            the product (only visible to buyers). After collecting required
            info, the items can be delivered.

          <li>
            <b>NFTs:</b> It is possible to execute <b>any on-chain logic</b>{" "}
            during product purchase (requires setting up a custom smart
            contract). You could use it to mint an NFT, use merkle proof

    question: "What are products",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Each slicers comes with a <b>decentralized store</b> from where you
          can sell anything. All payments end up to the slicer by default, which
          are then split among its owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, products are not NFTs themselves. They are a new
          primitive that is used to handle on-chain inventory and store
          non-transferable purchases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Products can be used to represent anything — tickets, physical items,
          files, services, NFTs or a combination of those — it&apos;s the seller
          that decides what each product is related to.

  {
    question: "How are texts and files encrypted in products",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Sellers have the option to give private texts and files to buyers.
          Their content is automatically encrypted and saved immutably on IPFS
          using Filecoin (via{" "}
          <a href="https://web3.storage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Web3 Storage
          </a>
          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          The data can only be decrypted via Slice by redeeming the product,
          using a symmetric key generated only to those who have purchased it.

  {
    id: "metadata",
    question: "What's in the slicer metadata",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          The slicer metadata are the name, description, image, tags and all
          other info related to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To customize them create a slicer first, then go to its page and click
          on the pencil near its title (you need to be a superowner to see it).
          From there you&apos;ll be able to change all information related to
          it, influencing how it appears online and on nft marketplaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that slicer metadata is stored on Slice servers, not on IPFS.
          This is because some of the data displayed on nft marketplaces is
          dynamic (ie ETH received by slicer), and also because slicers
          generally serve a different purpose than typical NFTs.

  {
    question: "What are sponsorships",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Whenever someone sends ETH to a slicer without buying a product, it
          counts as a sponsorship. The 10 top sponsors will appear on the slicer
          page and are able to <b>customize their space by adding a link</b> to
          redirect users that click on their address/ENSname.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can send ETH for a sponsorship through a standard ETH transaction
          to the slicer address, or by using the apposite form in the{" "}
          <i>sponsorships</i> section of its page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Sponsorships are an experimental part of Slice and may be
          handled differently in the future.

    question: "How to redeem physical items or tickets from product purchases",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Tickets (and purchases in general) are linked to the buyer’s address
          and are not transferable. Anyone can always verify if an address has
          purchased a product by interacting with Slice subgraph or contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Redeeming physical items generally requires{" "}
          <b>verifying ownership of the buyer&apos;s address</b> by following
          instructions provided by the seller. You can find them by redeeming
          the related product in{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          This step tipically requires to sign a message to verify wallet
          ownership either upon entering the venue or anytime earlier on a third
          party website, such as the seller&apos;s.

        <p>
          The Slice protocol is <b>free</b>, users only have to pay the
          transaction fees to interact with the blockchain. This website is just
          an interface to the Slice&apos;s smart contracts.

        <p>
          Whenever a slicer owner withdraws earnings from slicers, a{" "}
          <b>2.5% SLX cashback fee</b> is given to the Slice DAO which helps
          funding the development of the protocol.
