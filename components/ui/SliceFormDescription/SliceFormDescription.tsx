                  The slicer itself will be the decentralized store, so first of

              <>
                <p>
                  Slicers are collaborative tools but you can also create a
                  slicer just for yourself, or someone else. You may consider
                  doing so:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To sell products from a d-store without sharing ownership
                    with others.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you don&apos;t know the other owners in advance, you
                    could mint the slices to yourself and transfer them later.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </>
            }

              <>
                <p>
                  One of the distinctive characteristics of the Slice protocol
                  is that <b>slices are freely tradable</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dynamic payments splitting means that{" "}
                  <b>
                    the slicer splits any payment received based on its current
                    owners

                  .
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let&apos;s say you own 20 out of 100 slices of a certain
                  slicer, granting you 20% over its earnings. If you
                  transferred/sold 5 slices, from that moment on you&apos;d get
                  15% of any payment to the slicer. At the same time the new
                  owner would receive the remaining 5%.

            question="How to pick number of slices"
            answer={
              <>
                <p>
                  The total number of slices defines the{" "}
                  <b>minimum divisible unit of ownership</b>. If a slicer has
                  100 slices, each slice entitles to 1% ownership. If it&apos;s
                  1M slices, each slice gives 0,0001%.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is no right or wrong amount, the only effect is to
                  increase/decrease partial ownership that slicer owners may
                  trade in the open market (nft marketplaces).
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the displayed percentage is green, the owner is also a
                  superowner (see below to learn more).
